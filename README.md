# Java_Algorithms

DESCRIPTION: 

 The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting with 2. It is an efficient way to find prime numbers, with a time complexity of O(n*log(log(n))) and a space complexity of O(n).


FEATURES:

Finds all prime numbers up to a given limit
Efficient algorithm with good time and space complexity

INSTALLATION:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Compile the Java file using the command "javac SieveOfEratosthenes.java"
Run the program using the command "java SieveOfEratosthenes <limit>" where <limit> is the upper limit for prime numbers to be found.


USAGE:

The user can specify the upper limit for prime numbers to be found as a command line argument.
The program will output all prime numbers up to the given limit.
